# Python_Challenge

The main goal of this was gather data in regards to obtaining Colorado's Board of Education votes when it came to candidates in 3 different local counties, which are Jefferson, Denver and Arapahoe. Given the information provided by them, we can piece together with specific data how to analyze using tools such as Visual Studio Code or Python to retrieve election results. Esentially, the main project overview of this challenge was to analyze the votes between candidates, calculate the percentage of votes each candidate win, the total number of each candidate win and the winner of the election based on the popular votes. From this, we can determine exact data to provide to the public.
